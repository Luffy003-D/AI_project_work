# Project Name: 
A Mouse Social Behavior Recognition System Based on Multimodal Spatiotemporal Features

# Research Background:
In neuroscience research, precise quantification of mouse social behavior is crucial for understanding brain social mechanisms and psychiatric disease pathology. Currently, this field primarily relies on manual observation methods, which have inherent limitations including strong subjectivity, low efficiency, and poor reproducibility.

Although computer vision technology can already capture animal motion trajectories through pose estimation, achieving accurate and automatic recognition of social behaviors from this data still faces three major challenges: the spatiotemporal complexity of social interactions, the need for model generalization across different experimental environments, and the difficulty in distinguishing between subtle behavioral differences.

To address this, this project aims to develop an innovative computational framework that integrates kinematic features, spatial relationship features, and temporal dynamic features to construct a machine learning system capable of automatically and accurately identifying mouse social behaviors. The research outcomes will provide an efficient and reliable analytical tool for neuroscience research.
