# üê≠ Mouse Social Behavior Recognition (MABe Challenge)

## üìå Project Overview
This project is part of our AI Application course group work.  
We participate in the [MABe Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/MABe-mouse-behavior-detection), which focuses on **automatic recognition of mouse social and non-social behaviors** from pose estimation data.  
Our goal is to design and implement machine learning models that can classify over 30 behaviors in pairs and groups of mice, based on large-scale annotated video datasets.

## üß© Project Background
In neuroscience research, precise quantification of mouse social behavior is crucial for understanding the brain‚Äôs social mechanisms and the pathology of psychiatric diseases.  
Traditionally, this work has relied on manual observation, which is **subjective, time-consuming, and difficult to reproduce**.  

Recent advances in computer vision allow researchers to estimate animal poses and track motion trajectories, but **automatically recognizing complex social behaviors from these data remains challenging**. The main difficulties include:  
- The **spatiotemporal complexity** of multi-agent interactions  
- The need for **generalization across different experimental environments**  
- The difficulty of distinguishing **subtle behavioral differences**  

The [MABe Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/MABe-mouse-behavior-detection) provides a large-scale dataset with over 400 hours of annotated video from 20+ labs, covering 30+ behaviors. This competition encourages the development of robust machine learning models that can achieve human-level accuracy in behavior recognition, with the potential to accelerate neuroscience, ethology, and computational biology research.  

Our project aims to address these challenges by integrating **kinematic features, spatial relationships, and temporal dynamics** into a unified computational framework for mouse social behavior recognition.
