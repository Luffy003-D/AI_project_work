# üê≠ Mouse Social Behavior Recognition (MABe Challenge)

## üìå Project Overview
This project is part of our AI Application course group work.  
We participate in the [MABe Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/MABe-mouse-behavior-detection), which focuses on **automatic recognition of mouse social and non-social behaviors** from pose estimation data.  
Our goal is to design and implement machine learning models that can classify over 30 behaviors in pairs and groups of mice, based on large-scale annotated video datasets.

## üéØ Objectives
- Build baseline and advanced models for behavior recognition  
- Explore spatio-temporal and multi-modal feature representations  
- Submit valid predictions to Kaggle and evaluate performance using the official F-score metric  
- Document our methodology, experiments, and results for the course project

## üìä Dataset
- **Source**: MABe Challenge Dataset  
- **Scale**: 400+ hours of video, 20+ recording systems, 30+ behaviors, frame-level expert annotations  
- **Note**: Due to its size, the dataset is *not included* in this repository  
- **Access**: Download via Kaggle API or directly from the competition page  
- We will provide instructions in `docs/dataset_instructions.md` for setting up the dataset locally
